The Build An Agent Workshop teaches you how to create AI agents that can perform complex tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools. You'll build a **Report Generation Agent** - an intelligent system that can research any topic, create comprehensive outlines, write detailed sections, and compile professional reports automatically. Unlike simple workflows, agents are intelligent programs that can adapt to changing requirements, choose tools dynamically, and perform complex reasoning and planning.

This workshop will help you get started building AI agents from scratch. At the end of this workshop, you will take home:

* Understanding of the four core components of any AI agent
* A working document generation agent that can research and write reports
* Knowledge of how to build agents using LangGraph and NVIDIA NIM
* A turn-key, portable development environment
* Your own customized agent ready to share as a launchable

The entire workshop can take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to complete.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to create an agent that can:
- Use tools to perform actions
- Maintain conversation context
- Make decisions about next steps
- Handle complex multi-step workflows
