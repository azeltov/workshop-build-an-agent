# Agentic RAG Workshop

<img src="_static/robots/surfwithshorts.png" alt="Workshop Robot Character" style="float:right;max-width:300px;margin:25px;" />

The Agentic RAG Workshop teaches you how to build intelligent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using NVIDIA technology and LangGraph. You'll create an **IT Help Desk Agent** - an intelligent system that can dynamically decide when and how to search knowledge bases to answer user queries. Unlike traditional RAG systems that always perform the same retrieval steps, agentic RAG gives the model control over when and how to use retrieval as a tool.

This workshop will help you understand the evolution from basic LLMs to traditional RAG to intelligent agentic RAG systems. At the end of this workshop, you will take home:

* Understanding of traditional RAG limitations and how agents solve them
* A working IT Help Desk agent using ReAct architecture
* Knowledge of NVIDIA's embedding, reranking, and chat models
* Experience with LangGraph's agent creation tools
* A vector database implementation using FAISS
* Your own customized agentic RAG system

The entire workshop can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours to complete.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to:
- Build vector databases with document chunking and embeddings
- Implement retrieval chains with NVIDIA NeMo Retriever
- Create ReAct agents that can decide when and how to use those chains
- Use LangGraph to orchestrate NVIDIA NIM services
