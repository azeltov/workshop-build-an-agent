Ready to save your AI agent work? Let's get your customized agent code published to GitHub so you can share it with others!

## Step 1: Fork this repo

Before you can publish your changes, you'll need to have your own copy of this repository on GitHub. If you do not have a GitHub account, [sign up for free](https://github.com/join).

Now you can
[<i class="fa-solid fa-code-fork"></i> fork this repo](https://github.com/brevdev/workshop-build-an-agent/fork)
to your own profile!

## Step 2: Open a terminal

For these next steps, we will do a few git commands. Open up a new <button onclick="openNewTerminal();"><i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> terminal</button>.

<!-- fold:break -->

## Step 3: Login to GitHub

In the terminal, we need to login to GitHub so we can push code changes.

To help with this, the GitHub CLI is available.

```bash
gh auth login
```

In the following prompts, select the following options:

```
? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? HTTPS
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser
```

You will be given a one-time code. Type that code into the [GitHub Device Login](https://github.com/login/device) page and follow the prompts to authenticate this machine.

<!-- fold:break -->

## Step 4: Change your Git remote

Now we can tell Git that you would like to start pushing to your own GitHub profile.
Make sure to update the URL in this command with your GitHub Username.

```bash
cd /project
# Change the remote origin to point to your forked repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/workshop-build-an-agent.git
```

<!-- fold:break -->

## Step 5: Commit and Push your Changes

Using git, we will commit our changes. This will locally track the changes that were made.
Then we will push our commits up to GitHub.

```bash
cd /project
git add -A
git commit -m "My first changes."
git push
```

<!-- fold:break -->

## Success! 

ðŸŽ‰ Your agent is now saved to your GitHub repository! You can view it online, share the code with others, or use it as the foundation for creating a launchable.
